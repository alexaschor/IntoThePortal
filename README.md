_Abstract:_ We present an efficient new method for computing Mandelbrot-like fractals (Julia sets) that approximate a user-defined shape. Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than previous methods, as it entirely sidesteps the need for a time-consuming numerical optimization. It is also more robust, succeeding on shapes where previous approaches failed. The key to our approach is a versor-modulus analysis of fractals that allows us to formulate a novel shape modulus function that directly controls the broad shape of a Julia set, while keeping fine-grained fractal details intact. Our formulation contains flexible artistic controls that allow users to seamlessly add fractal detail to desired spatial regions, while transitioning back to the original shape in others. No previous approach allows Mandelbrot-like details to be "painted" onto meshes.

## This Repo

First of all, thanks for coming to this page! If you have any questions at all or problems with the code, please email me at `<my github username>@gmail.com` and I'll do my best to help. 

This is the code used to generate the meshes used in most of the paper figures. It should build with `make`, though you might have to edit `projects/include.mk` with your compiler and compiler flags. For an interactive, (mostly) real time 2D version that allows you to play with the parameters, check out https://github.com/alexaschor/JSM2D
